# CAITLibot123

CAITLibot is a tool for generating bespoke, student-led, AI-powered learning activities, designed for GCSE and A level students (aged 14-18).

It is currently being used by teachers at Eton College in the UK, as well as a handful of other schools and trusts.

CAITLibot is an Express.js application that integrates with the OpenAI API. To use it, you'll need to sign up for an OpenAI account, top up with some credit, and generate an API key. $10 would be more than enough to get started. It could also use the Google Gemini API instead, with minimal modification (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#javascript).
